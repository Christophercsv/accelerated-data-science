Oracle AutoMLx
==============

.. note::
    Working with AutoML has moved from within ADS to working directly with the AutoMLx library. 
    With AutoMLx moving into the open source domain, working directly with the library has many benefits.
    One of these is that ADS and AutoMLx can now have independent version cadences. 
    AutoMLx is under active development, and will be expanding into areas of explainability, fairness and deep learning. 
    To offer this functionality, the best way is for the ADS to work together as separate libraries.
    AutoMLx are preinstalled in conda pack automlx_p38_cpu_v2 and later, and can now be updated independently of ADS. AutoMLx documentation may be found at `this link <https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/automlx/latest/html/multiversion/v23.1.1/index.html>`__. 
    Notebook examples are in `Oracle's samples repository <https://github.com/oracle-samples/oci-data-science-ai-samples/tree/master/notebook_examples`__ and a migration tutorial can be found at :doc:`../../../user_guide/model_training/automl/quick_start.html>`__.
