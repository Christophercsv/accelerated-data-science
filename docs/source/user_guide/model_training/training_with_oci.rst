Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) `Data Science Jobs (Jobs) <https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/jobs-about.htm>`_
enables you to define and run repeatable machine learning tasks on a fully managed infrastructure.
You can have Compute resource on demand and run applications that perform tasks such as
data preparation, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

Here is an example for training MNIST model with PyTorch using source code directly from GitHub.
