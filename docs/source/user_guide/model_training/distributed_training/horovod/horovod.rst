**Distributed training framework for TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch**

Horovod is an open-source software framework for distributed deep learning
training using ``TensorFlow``, ``Keras``, ``PyTorch``. ``Horovod`` has the goal of improving
the speed, scale, and resource allocation when training a machine learning model.

OCI Data Science currently support `Elastic Horovod <https://horovod.readthedocs.io/en/stable/elastic_include.html>`_ workloads with `gloo <https://github.com/facebookincubator/gloo>`_ backend.
