============
IAM Policies
============

To unleash the full potential of operators, you might need to configure policies based on the environment you're using.


Object Storage
--------------

In order to store the results in an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage bucket and retrieve source data from there, it may be necessary to set up specific policies for these actions.

Oracle Container Registry
-------------------------

To facilitate the publication of an operator's containers to the Oracle Container Registry, you may be required to configure the authentication token for this purpose.

Data Science Job
----------------

If you're running operators within Oracle Cloud Infrastructure DataScience Jobs, ensure you have the appropriate policies in place to grant access and permissions.

Data Flow Application
---------------------

When working with Data Flow Applications in Oracle Cloud, similar policy configurations may be necessary.
